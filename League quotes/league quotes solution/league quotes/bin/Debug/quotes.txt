"Pantheon, I see you! Like a lamprey you attach yourself to a host! I will carve you from this mortal's form, and eviscerate you both!"
"Pantheon! I will crush your godhood, I will eviscerate your ideals, even your memory... I will trample!"
"Targon sends an aspect against me? Prepare yourself, Pantheon, I will end all that you hope to be!"
"They think me defeated, enchained. But I am unbowed... Noble is this carnage."
"I am your reckoner, mortals."
"Challenge me, mortals! I am here!"
"Am I the abyss? Or did I gaze into it?"
"The only peace I seek... is death!"
"I am oblivion, I am destruction... I am doom."
"The true sound of my blade can only be heard when they loathe re-incarnation."
"This cursed form... This crude decaying flesh! I loathe it!"
*Laughs* "Let them lament... my name."
"I stood against the void. Now... I would welcome it."
"I cannot die... until all life ends."
"Primitives worship me, hoping for mercy. I shall give them death."
"They will call me a god killer!"
"I am doom!"
"As long as this form lives, I will punish them."
"My suffering... I will make it bloom."
"My darkness was not born, it was forged by my prison."
"I am not a king, I am not a god, I am... worse..."
"Those who call me enemy, I welcome them."
"I will snuff out the light, I shall make darkness eternal!"
"All that lives, I will end!"
"There is a darkness in my heart deeper than any shadow!"
"I march to death... Though I wish it was my own..."
"I will drown them in oceans of blood!"
"Patience, Aatrox! Patience! Your freedom will come!"
"Gods and mortals, they deserve only death!"
"Kneel mortals! So I may split your shoulders from your spine!"
"March toward vengeance... Drown this world in blood!"
"I must destroy even hope."
"For my imprisonment, they will suffer!"
"I will render these mortals' forms into my own!"
"Their screams will be like the soothing hum of insects at dusk."
"I am ready to be the World-Ender!"
"I am Aatrox, I am the World-Ender!"
"Carnage, hate, yes! I am the World-Ender!"
"Take everything from them! Become the World-Ender!"
"Insects, the World-Ender has come!"
"This is the time, the World-Ender is here!
"Death to all! The World-Ender awaits!"
"See your World-Ender!"
"Bow worms! Bow before the World-Ender!"
"Behold, the World-Ender!"
"I bring silence! I am the World-Ender!"
"Quiet yourselves, the World-Ender is here!"
"There is no escape from the World-Ender!"
"Now, I am the World-Ender!"
"Tricked into this existence... False slave entrapped by endless life! I shall become a beast feeding on their destruction, and making them lament my unholy birth!"
"I have no goodness left, it was taken from me, stolen! I... am the nemesis of life."
"They sing of love, hope and gods, all that makes them want to live! So, I will quiet that first!"
"I shall take their limbs. I will reap their beloved! I will tear from their consciousness, the will to live. Yes, this is my purpose."
"Cleave through them, Aatrox! Crush their skulls! Shatter their ribs! Disembowl their very souls!" *Heavy breathing* "Our vengeance is at hand!"
"Every dream is a candle I must snuff out... I... am the darkness..."
"The heavens, the endless skies folding into each other. Where are they now?"
"How far I have fallen! A god... reduced to a prisoner!"
"Once in noble battle, I screamed against the silence. I stood as light against the darkness. Now, I serve a new master... oblivion..."
"See what beasts they have reduced us to... Creatures of flesh sustained only by this filth's blood and form!"
"From entire villages and towns, I will rend the flesh... Until I stand... as an unholy god."
"March flesh, march toward them! We have horrors to sow! Lives to reap! Let me make them regret... being free."
"Dark deeds I will do this day... Though I will carry myself as my former pride dictates!"
"Where I was excellence, I am deformed... Recast poorly with these crude materials. But this abomination of flesh well serves my murderous intent."
"I shall not kiss the ground, nor let myself be wielded as a tool! I am damned, but I will remake this world in my dark image!"
"Let me tear their flesh from them. Let me break their souls... And murder their dreams."
"They will call me villain... Come, let me earn their hatred, again and forever."
"I am but an unholy copy of life... A mockery of its freedom... And born in the cruel betrayal of the noble ideals I would've served."
"I touched the stars, and saw the glorious light of a thousand suns! Now, blinded by this elegance, how could my purpose be anything... but dark..."
"I beg, let some challenge me today... So that I may tear out their hearts! Pray! Let me watch them die, eyes knowing they served... my dark purpose..."
"No beast so fierce, but knows some touch of pity... But I know none... and therefore am no beast." *Laughs*
"To war, Aatrox! They shall not rob us of our nobility! We shall stand, and spit venom at our tormentors for eternity!"
"I do not obey! I cannot lay down! I will be the ender of all things!"
"We march to battle... Let me carve flesh, let me cloak myself in the slaughter! Hide me in their carnage... Hide me from this suffering..."
"We had another name once... Now, we are Darkin."
"I shall regard their cries as braying steeds, waiting to be whipped, broken, and bridled!"
"I am in a cage within a prison... But this foul shape reminds me of my purpose!"
"Do you see my edge?! Your death awaits!"
"Pray, fool! You face a Darkin."
"This violence shall amuse!"
"Our duel begins."
"Come closer! I will show you... darkness!"
"Come, fight me!"
"Tricks, Akali? They will not hide you from me, face your doom."
"Another foolish god, even the phoenix shall end."
"Scissors for legs... Okay, I thought I had seen stupid designs before... Alright, let's go."
"Look at your noble courage, Darius! Now learn... despair."
"You are unloved, Mundo! Now, face judgement!"
"I know your name, Fiora. This is not a duel you shall win."
"A statue? Rock shatters as easily as bone! Come!"
"Guns and oranges? Are you a clich√© or a joke? Come! Fight! Die!"
"Scream 'Demacia', Garen! Scream its name before I crush you, and it!"
"I kill gods, priestess. Let us continue this fight... until all things stop!"
"A worthy vessel! Come, Jax!"
"You would rush towards me, Kai'Sa? What fool would build a strategy on that idea? Come, let us begin."
"Let me show you your error, Kayle! You are not worthy of ascension! You, are not worthy of the worms!"
"Ooh, a shadow warrior! How edgy!"
"I did not think my fellows weak, Rhaast! Already you disappoint me!"
"A lightning squirrel?" *Laughs* "Thank you! Your death will amuse me!"
"Are you a joke, you loud, horrible thing? I shall kill you and your steed!"
"Where is your head, rock thing? Where is the neck I shall sever?"
"Am I challenged by a tree?! Fine, let me build a pyre from you!"
"You would bind yourself to this realm. Morgana? Fine, let me show you the ground!"
"Nasus, is your wisdom enough to know your fate? I am your death!"
"Your noble purpose amuses me, Nautilus! Fight me, see true death!"
"Hail father Ornn, god of fire and forge!" *Laughs* "I am Aatrox, and I am the god killer!"
"Hail Pantheon! Let me hear you cry of friendship! Let me hear you scream of brotherhood!"
"Hail Pantheon! See the weapon I have become! Watch as you are destroyed!"
"Hail Pantheon! How noble and proud he carries himself! Come betrayer! Come fiend!"
"A bird? You would challenge me with a bird?!" *Laughs* "Come!"
"Renekton! In your madness, you know my suffering! Though I shall end yours."
"Riven, dance, child! That broken blade is no match for me!"
"You would challenge me in a machine? You are a strange spirit, Rumble."
"A spirit blade, master Shen? Test it agaist me, let me shatter your illusions!"
"Yes Sion! I kill even that which will not die! I end all things!"
"Hail the protector! Hail Taric, aspect of- get a haircut!"
"Cowardly spirit, how annoying you are! I will savour killing you, Teemo!"
"A troll king?! Come! Defend you throne, king of trolls!"
*Laughs* "Yes, Tryndamere! I am the cause of your suffering! See if you can cut justice from me!"
"I wait for you, Tryndamere! Come, take your vengeance!"
"Remember the screams of your kinsmen as you fall to me, Tryndamere!"
"Rage? You are just flesh, Tryndamere, ready for harvesting!"
"You would end worlds? As a bow?!"
"I will not send you to death, Yorick! I bring oblivion!"
"I know it was you, trickster! You gave them the tools to trap me! Come, let me kill you! A thousand times isn't enough!"
"I am like a demon, but more edgy, right? You know, cause I'm a sword. Hmm..."
"So uh, I'm Aatrox. I'm a transcendental being trapped inside cutlery... What's your deal?"
"Uh, nice world you have here. I intend to destroy it, you know, FYI."
"A scythe? A scythe?! Are you planning on murdering fields of wheat?!"
"I chose a sword, the noblest weapon, Rhaast. You- seriously I don't understand... Were you trapped in the gardening section?"
"We all agreed on the double 'A' thing, Varus. The double 'A' thing!"
"Varus, 'V' 'A' 'R' 'U' 'S', your name should have an 'A' and then another 'A', Varus. There was a memo, Varus, there was a memo!"
"I will find a way to tear down the heavens and reveal you as fiends! Not today obviously..."
"Do I resemble you, abomination? Your form isn't my destiny... is it? You don't know how to talk, do you? Shit..."
"Come, let me show you darkness!"
"Fight! Join me in death!"
"Your death awaits!"
"I will hack and chop and cleave, and sunder the filth of your forms!"
"I am not your enemy, I am the enemy!"
"I am Darkin! Your gods fear me!"
"I will sever your limbs! I will carve your souls!"
"Carnage is my method."
"I can smile, and murder while I smile."
"Suffer, as I suffer!"
"Carnage... Hoooooome..."
"Hear this cursed form sing!"
"Sorrow... I shall deliver it to you."
"I begged for death, now I am its bringer!"
"I am the god killer!"
"Come!" *Grunt* "Destiny awaits!"
"You would fight me?! Come, let me show you hell!"
"Your annihilation beckons!"
"Violence... distracts me from these chains!"
"I come for you, Pantheon."
"The power of an aspect, wasted on a fool!"
"I killed your tribe. Now, join them!"
"Tryndamere! This is your destiny!"
"I will gut you, and tear you from existence, trickster!"
"Aspect of change! Now you die!"
"Fight! Or be forgotten!"
"Become... hate!"
"I offer you victory!"
"Let blood be our sacrament!"
"Follow me into destruction!"
"This is your absolution."
"To the end of times, I shall kill you again and again."
"This was reckoning."
"You die... a fool."
"I brought you the one true gift, I brought you... death!"
"Your broken form speaks only of failure."
"Carnage, my last joy."
"This is the silence I seek."
"I will have silence."
"Resurrect! Return! So I may kill you again..."
"This is my gift to mortals."
"I sing only in your deaths."
"I do not need to show my mastery, it is self-evident."
"Resurrection, an endless cycle of life... A dead bird."
"What foolish plan bore a woman such as you, Camille? You were a folly, crafted by an idiot."
"The axe suited you, Darius, the weapon of a simpleton!"
"I expected you to be nimble, Fiora. Too easily, my blade crushed your spine."
"Yo ho, Gangplank, yo ho."
"Demacia!" *Laughs* "Whatever 'Demacia' is, I will slay it next!"
"In time I will learn how to kill even your god, Illaoi!"
"I cannot know if I was corrupted by the void, but at least my choices were not asinine."
"Die, Kayle, knowing your potential will never be reached."
"I cannot have brotherhood with incompetence."
"What is property? Why did this dead hamster want me off of it?"
"I kill mountains, Malphite! Dumb piles of rocks!"
"Hear me, tree spirit. Your form is but kindling, and your forests I will burn!"
"You disgust me, Morgana. Die in the filth of your bound flesh!"
"Yes, Shurima was meant to fall, Nasus, as were you!"
"Journey back to the deep!"
"Ornn, like all gods, you disappoint!"
"Pantheon, you crawl forward like a worm! Ready to be squashed again?"
"Now your body matches your blade, Riven: broken and worthless!"
"Die, Shen, knowing the Eye of the Twilight is blinded and plucked."
"You fought to live, Sion, yet it is I who am still alive. This at least amuses."
"Lord of starlight, lord of hair! I trample on your corpse, Taric! I spit on your aspect's purpose!"
"A spirit for cowards, I laugh at your tricks and mushrooms!"
"I thought you my next vessel, Tryndamere. Pity, you failed even to become a slave."
"Return again to your prison, Varus. Think upon your worthlessness!"
"Honestly, a bow and two boys? What was your plan, Varus?"
"How I loathe your freedom, trickster! I will take this vengeance upon you, until the end of times!"
"Mastery? I must congratulate you, obviously your parents never had reason to."
"Yes, your mastery is the master of masters! I am fighting... an imbecile..."
"Somehow, I doubt you've mastered self-esteem."
"Mastery, how I idolise your greatness! Though I suspect your weapon lacks... impact."
"Ah, mastery, well done! Now master your insignificance."
"Insects, you think you can kill me? Behold my curse!"
"I am Darkin! I do not die!"
*Heavy breathing* "I... return!"
"You cannot destroy me!"
"I do not die!"
*Grunt* "Nothing can kill me!"
"I return!"
"Behold, immortality!"
*Laughs* "Yes! Fight me!"
"My will... is beyond death!"
"I... am not a mortal!"
"Did you think you could kill me?!"
"You think you can kill me?"
"As long as life exists, as long as time has meaning, I am not done!"
.Ahri
"Don't you trust me?"
"Play time's over."
"Shall we?"
"Indulge me."
"How tempting."
"Don't hold back."
"Tell me a secret."
"Don't you trust me?"
"I know what they desire."
"Should I make your pulse rise? Or... stop!" *Giggles*
"If you'd like to play with me, you'd better be sure you know the game."
"Come try your luck, if you think you're in my league." *Giggles*
"Playtime's over."
"They're mine now."
"It's too late for mercy."
"Let's have some real fun."
"No one will stand in my way."
"They've exhausted their use."
.Akali
"Fear the assassin with no master."
"You're scared, good to know."
"No one tells me what to do. Not anymore."
"Cold steel and a target are all I need."
"I love what I do, my enemies won't."
"They can't stop me. I mean, they can try."
"I work alone, It's better for everyone."
"If they're smart, they're scared."
"I am my own master. Just the way I like it."
"Wars are messy. My kills are clean."
"Everyone dies, I just speed things up."
"You can never have too many kunai."
"Don't waste the anger, channel it."
"No more meditation or masters."
"Youth and skill, every time."
"Let 'em see me, they can't stop me."
"The words on their tombstones will be my new mantras."
"Kama or kunai? Depends how I'm feelin'."
"It's not about the killing, it's about who's doing the dying."
"I make problems... disappear."
"Can't stop what's comin'."
"Gonna carve my own path."
"Stay outta my way!"
"Playtime's over."
"How about I just end this."
"Let's end this."
"Let's make this quick."
"Time to do what's gotta be done."
"Skill and steel will get the job done."
"You will not stop me!"
"The only rule that matters is that your enemies don't walk away."
"If you look dangerous, you better be dangerous."
"Restraint's not really my thing."
"The fist of shadow was my mom. I do things differently."
"Take one life at a time. Fast. Clean."
"We're gonna do this my way, quick, and deadly."
"I'll make this look like magic."
"Magic's fine, steel's better."
"So many enemies, so many knives."
"It's not the killing I'm about, it's the cause."
"The Kinkou couldn't control me. I do what they wouldn't."
"There are over 300 pressure points on the human body, no one can protect 'em all."
"Everyone's got a weakness, that's my target."
"Forget balance, this is a reckoning."
"The rules hold you back, leave 'em for someone who needs 'em."
"Your window to run away... is closing."
"Call it a purse, I dare you."
"I was trained to kill since I could walk."
"Look, I don't wanna kill you, but I will."
"Still time for you to do the smart thing: go home."
"You may wanna rethink this little encounter."
"You think you're gonna walk away?"
"You're gonna need those bandages little guy."
"Now you're really playing with fire, little girl."
"The will comes from within, not from the blade."
"Ugh, Jhin, what a drama queen."
"Jinx... Sketchy tats and certifiable? It's just sad."
"How about I take this life, Karma?"
"Katarina! Today you will bleed for Ionia!"
"Kayn... Why are the hot ones always crazy?"
"Time to snuff out the light, Lux!"
"Yi, another master no one needs."
"You prune the tree, I'm gonna pull some weeds."
"Big targets are easier to hit."
"Bad time to come back to the frontlines, Swain."
"Steel beats rock, Taliyah."
"Better run, Twitch. Hiding won't cut it."
"Ohoho, Zed... This I will enjoy."
"I'm here to finish what Shen couldn't."
"I am so sick of shadows."
"Let me show you my secrets, "Zed"."
"You know, we've never met, but you seem really annoying."
"Oh look, someone's got a deathwish."
"I can make this fast, or really fast. Choice is yours."
"You really want those to be your last words?"
"That is just another reason for you to die."
"It's who I am, get used to it."
"I'm right here!"
"Feel me now?!"
"Don't hold back!"
"Let's have some fun!"
"Well you aren't much of a challenge!"
"This won't take long!"
"Too fast! Too good!"
"Finally, let's do this!"
"Come on, at least try!"
"You're done!"
"Should've run!"
"Better bring it!"
"Let's go!"
"I can do this all day!"
"Try to keep up!"
"Quick and deadly!"
"Aha, you're gonna bleed!"
"Okay, this, I got."
"Can't stop me!"
"Our wills do not align!"
"Time for you to learn!"
"This, is necessary!"
"No more rules!"
"This must be done!"
"Secrets kept die with you, Zed!"
"No more masters!"
"Shadows don't scare me!"
"Actions have consequences!"
"Now, it's personal!"
"Hehe, come on, I dare ya!"
"Only good Noxian... is a dead one."
"Watch your back!"
"Your colors won't fly here!"
"Quickness is strength!"
"You came a long way to die!"
"Yeah!"
"See ya!"
"Heard you were tougher."
"That's right, payback hits hard."
"You're dead, I'm alive. See? Balance."
"Lesson learned."
"They had it coming."
"Deftly I travel, swiftly you die."
"Smoked 'em."
"Okay, that one was messy."
"Still feeling confident?"
"I was just warming up."
"You don't get back what I take."
"You look so peaceful."
"Like you had a chance."
"Mark acquired, and elliminated."
"Who's next?"
"I'm already thinking about my next target."
"Perfect execution."
"Aaaaaaand, scene."
"You both die, and both lose."
"What a shame, I liked that little guy."
"Ugh, that was gross."
"Exit the dragon."
"Twilight falls."
"Ugh, that was gross."
"Should've stayed hidden."
"Too fast for shadows."
"Okay..."

"Nothing can hold me back!"
"Now I'm angry."
"You must follow."
"I know the way."
"Nothing can hold me back."
"Stampede!"
"Now I'm angry."
"Mess with the bull and you get the horns!"
"You can't milk those."
"Who's ready to lock horns with me?!"
"You are strong!"
.Amumu
"I thought you'd never pick me."
"Aww."
"Okay."
"Where are we going?"
"Hey, come back."
"Let's find some friends."
"Come play with me."
"Let me give you a hug."
"Let's be friends forever."
"Would you like to be friends?"
"Let's play again some time!"
.Anivia
"On my wings."
"I shall endure."
"Meaning, in every snowflake."
"Something ancient stirs."
"I am neither the first, nor the last."
"What change will this wind bring?"
"Take time to reflect."
"I dream of eras past."
"Think beyond one lifetime."
"We are all connected."
"I will be reborn."
"Forever watchful."
"Winter wind, guide me."
"A thousand lives will I give for the Freljord."
"Let's soar."
"I have felt this corruption before."
"So young, so na√Øve!"
"Poor creatures, so confined by a single life!"
"Laying an egg isn't as easy as it looks."
"The chicken or the egg? Actually I came first."
"Find peace."
"Life passes so swiftly."
"I bring the storm."
"I shall endure."
"A great darkness approaches."
"The Freljord awakens."
"Do not tempt the blizzard."
"I will not forsake my home."
"I am the snow, wind, and ice."
"The cycle closes."
.Annie
"You wanna play too? It'll be fun!"
"I want a turn!"
"Have you seen my bear Tibbers?"
"This way!"
"Try to keep up!"
"Are we there yet?"
"I never play with matches."
"Don't be a scaredy cat!"
"Hop, skip, jump!"
"Come out, come out, wherever you are!"
"Beaten by a little girl... ha!"
"You can't come to Tibbers' tea party! Bleh!"
"I'm rubber and you're... on fire!"
"You smell like burning!"
"What's your favorite aminal? A bear?"
"Take that!"
"Don't make me hurt you!"
"Eeny, meeny, miny, burn!"
"Let's count to five!"
"I want a turn!"
"Play time!"
"Can they do this?"
"This is fun!"
"Ashes, ashes, they all fall down."
"Get 'em, Tibbers!"
"Bear hug!"
"Tibbers!"
"Yay, Tibbers!"
"Found him!"
"Hi! My friend Tibbers wants to meet you..."
"C'mon Tibbers, let's play one more."
.Aphelios
"So many weapons, Aphelios. The deadliest is your faith."
"Condemned to darkness, where our power grows."
"Aphelios‚Ä¶ I hear you. I know what you sacrifice."
"Even from across the celestial veil‚Ä¶ I will be with you, brother."
"It always starts with pain. We can only do this together, Aphelios."
"Your life upon the altar, brother‚Ä¶ I will not betray it."
"With every step, two steps. With every breath, two breaths."
"You knew this would not be easy, the way forward written in scars."
"You walk the path of darkness, but you do not walk it alone, brother."
"Remember what you have learned, brother."
"When your steps falter, brother, follow my voice."
"Find your orbit, brother."
"Do not look back, Aphelios."
"You are the weapon the Lunari need."
"By my word, you walk into the night."
"You are not alone. Remember our promise."
"I am your sister. I am listening."
"I'm never further than a whisper echoing in silence."
"Even when I close my eyes‚Ä¶ I'll never look away."
"I am with you‚Ä¶ shining above."
"Through your eyes, I see such wonders‚Ä¶"
"Beneath the mask of silence‚Ä¶ I know your true face, brother."
"Again and again, I see you reach‚Ä¶ for me."
"How can I help you when I put your life at risk?"
"From our fortress, I will guide you. I promise."
"I beseech the moon to protect you."
"I am right. This is what the moon tells me."
"Walk where I cannot."
"We must find each other before every first light."
"We're in this together. Darkness and light."
"As light reveals our path, so will darkness."
"The brighter my light, the stronger your shadow."
"We cannot let fear trap us in twilight."
"Darkness is not heresy. It lies within us all."
"The moon shines brightest in darkness."
"The dawn will know the night's silence."
"Each of us, an offering."
"All we ask is for a witness to our sorrow."
"We walk through violence. Born of shadow. Born of light."
"Even when the moon is new, it is there. A whisper to the shadows of your soul‚Ä¶ I am with you."
"It is as the moon revealed, Aphelios. As beautiful. As terrifying."
"Our path is set between the last breaths taken by our enemies."
"You will make death more than death, brother. You will make it holy."
"We cannot touch the moon. But its light can touch us. Shouldn't that be enough? Light, on our fingers‚Ä¶"
"Without pain, we would not need faith. The moon would not need us. We would not need each other, Aphelios."
"The fortress is quiet. If only you could be here, Phel. You would make this stone seem loud."
"If pain is what awaits us in the darkness, brother‚Ä¶ we must run to it, unafraid."
"What we want, what we need, what we must do‚Ä¶ I envy the ignorant."
"The Solari call us heretics, but when darkness comes, brother, they will need our light."
"You cannot feel the tear running down your cheek. I cannot wipe it away‚Ä¶"
"Our thoughts touch‚Ä¶ impossibly close. Which of us am I?"
"The fortress looms around me. It is everything. It is the only thing."
"You make yourself a weapon, so you do not have to feel. But you are not a weapon; you are my brother."
"Phel‚Ä¶ You have made every movement a thousand times. Until you bleed. Until you do not have to think."
"The pain makes you numb. But I can still feel, brother. I know the truth that pain hides."
"I see further through the celestial veil. What we call truth is shadow."
"Our faith will be tested."
"We have no enemies, Aphelios. Only those fated to meet us in the night."
"Diana knows the moon's name, Aphelios. I can feel it on her heart."
"The aspect of the moon. What is she fleeing? What has she done?"
"Our aspect has returned‚Ä¶ bringing darkness."
"Senna. In darkness, we find each other."
"Soraka knows our pain, yet tells us not to feel it. To deny ourselves."
"Yuumi is much friendlier when she visits me in the spirit realm, snuggling at my feet while I read Book and imagine the rain."
"We were born to twin destinies, to tragedy, as the sisters were before us."
"What do they hold if they only reach for the trigger?"
"The greatest power is the power greater than ourselves."
"To become a vessel for the heavens, one only needs faith."
"The moon is with us in darkness, but it is not there for us."
"The Solari do not see: we shine brightest with another's light."
"Hah."
"The power of your belief."
"Soul and skill converge."
"Through sacrifice, all things."
"By light, the moon speaks!"
"Believe, Aphelios."
"A reckoning in stone."
"We hide no longer."
"Night embrace you!"
"Weapons aimed by destiny."
"You have bled, so they will."
"Every movement, a ceremony."
"It ends in silence."
"Until night is everything."
"They orbit their end."
"You are the moon's eclipse."
"No thought moves your hand."
"This will be your voice."
"Your fight echoes even here."
"I send you‚Ä¶ light."
"In your hand. From my heart."
"I am with you!"
"The half moon, perfectly balanced."
"Death, arcing from your hand."
"An orbit of blades."
"Crescendum."
"Reach out, Aphelios."
"Stone and spirit return to you."
"Blessings of the moon."
"For every phase, a weapon."
"An omen in your grasp."
"Carry the faith with you."
"Born of night."

"Gravitum."
"Darkness will weigh upon them."
"They will not escape what is coming."
"Their steps will falter in darkness."
"A new moon. The same darkness."
"When you shine, the moon can worship. You did well, Aphelios."
"They are motes of dust, shimmering in moonlight."
"A prayer for their souls. Torn from the night."
"To make a life of death‚Ä¶ you do what you have to, brother."
"Not even she knew what she would do. That was why she was afraid."
"The heavens turn toward darkness. Now is our time."
"Mother moon, guide them."
"We bleed when we cannot cry."
"Only one of us is safe."
"Blood upon still lips."
"You will not suffer in silence.""Phel, you're hurt."
"Be careful, Phel."
"Phel, you're hurt."
*Aphelios groans and expires* "I'll find you. I promise."
*Aphelios groans and expires* "Phel‚Ä¶ I'm sorry."
*Aphelios groans and expires* "No, I was supposed to help you! I knew‚Ä¶"
"As darkness falls, the moon rises."
"Out of darkness, the moon is born anew."
"I will not let you die."
"Faith, brother."
.Ashe
"All the world on one arrow."
"Coward! May you die with your eyes closed."
"Avarosa guide me."
"Lead the target."
"We will unite the Freljord."
"Swiftly now!"
"We must press on!"
"Peace requires a steady hand."
"Do not confuse mercy for weakness."
"A battle worthy of the Freljord."
"Today, the fate of our people hangs in the balance."
"The Freljord shall unite!"
"Let's see how close they can get."
"My tribe will bring peace to the North. The South should fear us."
"Move quickly, position well, and the battle is won before blood is drawn."
"I will show them the power of an Iceborn."
"We are all kin of kin. Blood of blood."
"The day our tribes are one, the world will tremble."
"I am Freljordian. Family, tribe, they are all."
"I am a Warmother. I have given oaths to few. I have taken oaths from many."
"Seek peace, but bring the tools of war."
"The bow is my will given form. I am it. It is me."
"No fate is written, except by us."
"Gods and spirits guide us. But our lives... are our own."
"There will be peace in the Freljord. I will forge it."
"My people know only cold and hardship. I will teach them peace."
"I hold a bow of true ice. I hold my heart."
"Hearthbound and Iceborn, Spirit Walker and Fireborn, All Freljordians are my kin."
"I was born into poverty, all Freljordians are."
"I will not allow us to be divided. We are one."
"They think me cold. I have seen things the Southerners cannot imagine."
"What is goodness but trying to do better than your forebears?"
"The ice is not pain, it is surrender."
"Together, we are strong. Together, we are... Avarosan."
"I do not seek the throne of Avarosa."
"I dream of a nation for my people."
"When I say Avarosa, I hear my mother, and her dreams."
"Glory to the Volibear, the Thousand-Pierced Beast. Give my people the resilience of your wilderness and the fury of your storm."
"Praise Ornn, the Firebringer. I ask for your wisdom, First Builder and Forgelord."
"Praise Anivia, the Frostbringer. Let us feel the coming of change. Grant us the freedom to travel in safety."
"Praise Kindred, the Two Hunters. Pray we see death's approach, so we may complete our labors and die with our eyes open."
"Blessed Three Sisters. Give me strength to endure what I must. Give me courage to fight who I must. Give me knowledge to see the truth."
"Bless us, Ildhaurg, Warden of Sacrifice. Protect my husband. Protect my people. If my death pleases you, let it sustain my tribe."
"My mother loved me. She fought and died trying to give me a better life. So I fight, and will die fighting, to give all Avarosans a better life."
"I have heard no better words than 'The strong must try the impossible.' This is the oath I must fulfill."
"In the north, a great chieftain is called 'Warmother'. Who but a mother has the right to risk lives in war?"
"The goddess Avarosa... I say I hear her voice. But I hear only my mother's, and mourn her passing."
"I dream of the day after the tribes are unified. I dream of no longer needing to lead."
"It is not the goddess Avarosa's glory I wish to recapture; it is our people's."
"Hmph, 'Destiny'. I have always hated that word. It is a wyrm that ruins lives and murders innocence. It is a deceiver and bringer of woe."
"I am a Warmother‚Äîa chieftain. Only because no one else will do what must be done."
"We praise the leader who unifies, forgetting it is only the unity that matters."
"What is it to lead? It is to lie. It is to preach caution even when you are elated. It is to give hope even when you feel none."
"You do not aim a bow at the target, you fire knowing where the target will be. This is vision."
"I loved my mother. I loved my battlesister. I love my people. It is because of this love that I fight."
"Clan or tribe, they will join us. This is the will of Avarosa."
"Avarosan is the tribe of many, because all Freljordians are one people."
"Avarosa speaks one truth, as all gods must. She is our dream of unity."
"The Three Sisters are a myth that has strangled our people. It is a tale of failure."
"Know this! I am Ashe! I am the bow!"
"I am Ashe, Daughter of Grena! Warmother of the Avarosans!"
"Prepare yourself, you face an Iceborn!"
"Anivia, how often have I sought your guidance? And how like a god to betray a mortal's trust!"
"Braum! What are you doing over there?! Are you drunk?."
"Gragas! Are you blind?! You're on the wrong side! Again!"
"Lissandra, the fate of our people hangs in the balance, and you betray me?!"
"You named me battlesister and kin, Sejuani. Do not make me fight you!"
"Trolls are the enemy of mankind. You will die like a beast!"
"Tryndamere...? What have you become?!"
"Shaman, I am no enemy of the old gods or Sejuani. Must we fight?"
"Ancient One, go! The Volibear is honored here, but unwanted!"
"Take a good look; it's the last you'll get."
"This is the latest in Freljordian fashion. They call it a... skirt."
"This outfit makes total sense, just look closer and think about it... less."
"So, Braum. No shirt, huh? And I don't have pants. Yay, Freljord!"
"Braum, we are winter people from a frozen land. So we must... pop it, pop it!"
"So, which one is the pig? Kidding!"
"How do you like the curves? I was talking about the bow."
"Yay, Freljord! Did any of us get cold weather clothes?"
"No, really, put that apple on your head... ugh! Ah... ohh... hmm..."
"I don't have to see you to shoot you... ow! Ugh... ooh, really?"
"Ha hah! Check this out... ow! Ugh, who makes a bow out of ice?!"
"My aim is steady."
"My arrows fly true."
"I don't miss."
"I do my best work from afar."
"Never. Lose. Focus."
"This is my warning to you."
"Thunk."
"As ice shatters, so shall you."
"You face an Iceborn."
"Flee from the cold."
"My mercy has limits."
"You face true ice. You face death."
"For the Freljord!"
"You would challenge an Iceborn?"
"Fate will treat you coldly."
"Fate did not choose you."
"Feel winter's sting."
"I was raise for war. I am Iceborn."
"I greet you, as a Freljordian!"
"Hmph. The cold does not forgive."
"I will face you, sister."
"Strike quickly!"
"Faster than my arrows? I think not."
"Stand together!"
"This is the fury of an Iceborn!"
"Rain death!"
"Make it count!"
"I won't miss."
"Let fly!"
"Can't miss!"
"Arrows fly!"
"Away!"
"Reveal what is hidden."
"Lead our way."
"Show us a path!"
"Anivia guide us."
"Spirit, reveal our way."
"All that frost touches, we know."
"I AM THE BOW!"
"No one escapes my aim."
"No one escapes winter."
"No one escapes my bow."
"Right between the eyes."
"I only needed one shot."
"You fought an Iceborn. Death was the only possible outcome."
"Svaag, Warmblood, was that your best? I killed you without trying."
"Heh. Svaag, I've seen babies fight better than you."
"No sagas will mark their passing."
"Mark where they died, that was as close as the got."
"They fought an Iceborn, they died."
"Are all Southerners so weak?"
"Sejuani! Goodbye, sister."
"Die, troll. My tribe will destroy your foul race."
"Tryndamere, my love. I always suspected this would be our end."
"May the voices quiet for you, shaman."
"Man no longer needs the Volibear. Return, and I will slay you again."
"You will not conquer the Freljord! I will free it!"
"The Freljord unites!"
"Do your ancestors proud."
"I will face you, sister!"
"A battle worthy of Freljord."
.Aurelion Sol
"Naturally."
"Hmph. Tragic."
"They call me a comet. They call me a dragon. They have no words for my true form."
"Cower, worship, beg, they're all valid reactions."
"In a constantly shifting cosmos, a world this static is... refreshing."
"There simply are no other dragons like me."
"Hope. Wonder. Insignificance. Imagine what they'll feel when I complete the stars."
"The stars look very different today."
"This world holds the key to Targon's undoing."
"Targon has used me as its weapon for far too long."
"The heavens diminish without my attention."
"I would burn the cosmos to catch Targon in the flames."
"The depths of space crawl with terrible entities. Pray they ignore this world."
"There are countless colors, but I suppose a single rainbow is a good start."
"This sun is off its axis - it's been driving me crazy for eons now."
"Planetary life... the insufferable byproduct of dim stars."
"Targon's magic is crude, but potent."
"Nothing kindles wonder like the beauty of stars."
"Celestial dragons live and die by our own beautiful rules."
"Love is as real a force as gravity. Try it once in a while."
"Stars are not born, they are made... by me."
"A star's birth is as violent as it is breathtaking."
"I've waited millennia to watch Targon fall."
"All beings are made of the same stardust."
"With a few more basic elements I could really make this place shimmer."
"The stars are not to thank for any good luck one may experience."
"This sun could do with a new core."
"Any relevant species has been knocked back into the Stone Age once or twice."
"I wouldn't navigate by the stars. They are a work in progress."
"Each star is one of my hearts."
"My works are revered by worlds I have never even visited."
"Wherever I am is the fashionable part of the universe. Even here."
"Stars are wonder and love ignited."
"I spark passion into star fire."
"A star is so much more than a luminous sphere of wonder."
"If you ask me, we have set the bar too low for sentience."
"My home is in the cosmos, amongst my stars."
"The stories they tell about me? They're probably true."
"All terrestrial dragons are but pale imitations of my kind."
"Perhaps there is more to this world than I thought - not much, but enough."
"As Targon's influence wanes, mine grows."
"Why does anyone wish upon a star?"
"Stars never align for anyone - except me, of course."
"Sometimes, the stars gaze back."
"I kindled the furnaces of wonder."
"Only when darkness overwhelms the heavens will Targon realise its folly."
"My stars shine for all."
"Targon will be the pyre from which I forge a new heaven."
"I see a universe drained of light and heat, where not even a story will survive."
"I grieve for every star never born."
"Darkness is my only true enemy."
"Whenever I think my work is complete, I end up back here, under this sun."
"May I enter? Just joking - star dragons don't need permission."
"Your demise will be sung about for ages to come - only thanks to its proximity to me, of course."
"Your survival is not impossible, only very... very... very unlikely."
"I shall be the last thing you see. Lucky you."
"Make a wish. See if the stars answer. I'll wait."
"What is the definition of underwhelming? Oh, right! You."
"I used to wander the stars. Now I'm stuck down here, with you."
"On other worlds, there is emerging life more complex than you."
"You aspire to be human? Oh, darling, there are so many other variants on mediocrity!"
"I am... overwhelmed by an emotion when you are not around. It is called... happiness."
"Mages are infants grasping at the machinery behind reality. At least you have a plausible excuse."
"You Ascended certainly know how to pick an animal totem."
"Your immortality is but a grain of sand in time's vast desert."
"Pick a dimension, Bard, you're confusing them!"
"Were you born this flat, or did you work at it?"
"The funnier the hat, the greater the prestige, right?"
"You and Leona embody the same light. Typical Targon redundancy."
"It is always a moon's role to envy the stars."
"Oh, come on, have a little self-respect!"
"You would make an interesting dragon."
"If dunking is the apex of this primitive sport, then I am the queen of space."
"Made a mistake? Better rewind and repeat until you achieve mediocrity."
"Fear? Generic."
"Idealism? Hilariously outdated."
"Rage? Cute."
"Gunpowder and metal sticks. Enchanting."
"I've seen the main act. You're only a third-rate cover band."
"You do not understand your god, Illaoi."
"Imagine what you could do with a larger canvas."
"Life is short, go crazy once in a while, I get it."
"The sun? This sun? Oh, darling."
"You and Diana embody the same light. Typical Targon redundancy."
"All dazzle, no brilliance."
"There is a saying on this planet - "Dumb as a rock". It's not a compliment."
"You are going to kill me? Dressed like that?"
"Bravo, Nasus, you've ascended yourself into a dog! Now fetch me something more interesting."
"I could teach an old dog millions of new tricks, but I simply don't like you, Nasus."
"Your fate was sealed the moment you picked up Targon's spear."
"Are you burdened by your own monotony? Because I am."
"That whole practice of Ascension is adorably amusing, like a kitten trying to walk upright."
"Ah, Ryze, I see you've brought paper to take notes."
"True magic is beyond language. Writing merely butchers the intent."
"Magic tattoos? Where did you get those, magic prison?... oh."
"Almost interesting. Almost."
"A dragon's loyalty is a priceless gift. Do not waste it in the service of fools."
"Medium flame, and that is me being generous."
"Unfitting of the draconic lineage."
"Twinkle, twinkle, little star, do you wonder what you are?"
"The heavens drag on endlessly... much like a conversation with you."
"You're an Aspect? Let me guess - tackiness."
"Galaxies exist by my will - but, yes, that is certainly an impressive sword."
"Hm. Punching?"
"You are going to punch a star dragon. Good luck with that."
"Blood magic? How tragically primitive."
"I empathize with your life as a weapon, but have a little backbone."
"You bend time the way a child folds origami - cute, but nothing special."
"Runeterra. Am I right?"
"You're out of your league."
"Ah, mankind. Ever fumbling from one brink of cataclysm to the next."
"Humanity, surprisingly adept in the art of wrestling survival from the clutches of extinction."
"As far as fauna goes, humans strike a firm... middle."
"The Aspect of Targon? Sparks masquerading as lightning."
"I will cauterize Targon with star fire."
"Few can impress me. That is a compliment."
"Which star is your favorite? I made that one."
"I made the stars... but you inspire me to make more."
"First you start with some matter, then add star fire and voila! It basically does the rest itself."
"Runeterra? I mean the name of this world literally means 'magic earth'."
"I made the stars to illuminate the perpetual nothing, and mortals use them for... relationship advice."
"A sun is unimaginable celestial power - and thrilled mortals use theirs to coordinate this 'lunch time'."
"I make entropy look good."
"Of course I love Runeterra! You have buildings and... more buildings."
"Hello, Runeterra! Are you ready to rock?"
"Let's dance!"
"Join me in the dance cosmic!"
"Now we're playing with star fire!"
"My, how they stare."
"None shall tread upon the stars."
"Let's end this on a high note!"
"Time to give them a show."
"It's beyond too late to seek cover."
"You will know your place."
"Impending doom - exciting, isn't it?"
"Congratulations, you have earned my contempt."
"Lighten up, destruction needn't be a maudlin affair."
"Suns never burn for the benefit of dust."
"Useless and intolerable. Charming."
"Plenty more to come."
"Defending yourself? Adorably futile."
"Tedious being."
"Boring me is dangerous."
"I never bite. Too uncouth."
"I'm going to throw a star at you now. Good luck."
"You are more useful as dust."
"Too bad."
"I tried to like you."
"Nothing a little star fire cannot fix."
"Be useful. Be stardust. I'll help."
"Why would I spare such mediocrity?"
"You are woefully underprepared."
"Bravery is absurd - but admirable."
"Live through this, and we'll chat."
"I'll indulge your foolhardy nature."
"Admire... then die."
"Oh, you will shine."
"Defenses? Laughable."
"Be brighter. I'll help."
"Think cosmic - like this!"
"Not everyone shines brightly enough!"
"Irritating cluster of particles."
"To atoms!"
"Return to dust."
"Smoulder, then implode!"
"They are merely dust."
"Illuminate."
"Melt."
"What a pity."
"Dragon's breath it is."
"Good find."
"Terrestrial dragons - a study of flawed constitutions."
"Low dragon, unfitting of the name."
"You call yourself a dragon? You're low-flame at best."
"A dragon that still needs wings to fly? Keep trying, you'll get there."
"I did mean to call you back, but stars needed forging."
"Boop."
"Starstruck?"
"Wrong orbit. Wrong time."
"The stars weep for you. Just kidding - I already forgot your name."
"My wish upon a star came true."
"Nice job, just standing there."
"Stars are best viewed from a distance."
"The stars were not in their favor."
"I guess their fate was written in the stars."
"Accrete!"
"Pure star fire!"
"Time to gather the necessary matter!"
"Feels good to make things again!"
"Anyone want some stardust?"
"A little dim - but it still works."
"Beautiful - such a shame."
"This will be quite the deadly spectacle."
"And I'm barely trying!"
"This'll make them stare."
"This one has a little spark."
"Aim... and ignite!"
"Expanding my horizons."
"Stellar!"
"Time for a great expansion."
"My sphere of influence grows."
"All towers fall - it's just what they do when I'm around."
"Nothing they build can endure like the celestial firmament."
"Towers tend to crumble when I am in the vicinity."
"Topple, like all things crafted by mortals."
"The architects of these towers misunderstand object permanence."
"How many must I knock down before they learn?"
"You may look forward to more of this."
"Never stop when you're on a roll."
"I shall inscribe this moment in the stars."
"That ought to keep them talking for the next century or so."
"Cosmic dragon; five. Everyone else; zero. Please, take notes."
"Well, that was easy."
"Another mass extinction. So soon?"
"Put it on my tab. The name's Pantheon, with a P."
"Put it on Mount Targon's tab."
"Pay? Do you know who I am?"
"Just... my... style."
"Fine, take your gold."
"Money? How barbaric."
"I tend to burn through footwear."
"My feet rarely touch the ground."
"Some things are simply better with age."
"Ages? This thing has been around for centuries, tops."
"It's been around for ages? So... almost new."
"All things appreciate in value over time."
"Hats are always fashionable."
"As long as it's set at a jaunty angle I'm in."
"A snow globe? Perfect for my collect - to destroy you. Destroy you!"
"Shiny - but it's no star."
"Time to slow things down a bit."
"A bit gaudy for my tastes but exceedingly useful."
"Liandry's Torment - my benefit."
"Perfect for the bimillenial celestial masquerade ball."
"If Bard and Kindred can pull off wearing a mask, so can I."
"There are no echoes where I'm from."
"But a shadow of sound."
"So many magics staves."
"Always leave them begging for more."
"Don't miss me too much."
"I've seen enough."
"Always know when to make an entrance - and an exit."
"Alas, I am simply too beautiful for this world."
"Never said I was infallible."
"Left an exquisite corpse."
"The brightest stars shine on long after they're gone."
"Darling, you have but set my hearts free."
"With a lifespan as comically brief as yours, I suppose I can allow you to taste triumph at least once."
"Ah, the joys of lesser organisms rising up to slay their betters! If only they were aware of the impermanence of being... or the permanence of me."
"Stars never fall."
"Because I am a star dragon. That's why."
"It's not a comeback if one was never truly gone."
"Hello again. Let's have some fun."
"Energy never dies."

"Shurima! Your emperor has returned!"
"Your emperor shall return."
"Shurima will once again stretch to the horizon."
"Shurima is where all paths converge."
"The world is a desert. I am the oasis."
"It is my time. Put your faith in me."
"I will guide us to glory."
"Let us return to our rightful place, Nasus."
"It has been a long wait Nasus... but it will be worth it."
"Together, we shall strive toward victory, Sivir."
"It is our right to rule, Sivir."
"The power of the sun lives in Shurima."
"You need not follow, but you must witness."
"I will return Shurima to greatness."
"Those who follow me follow destiny."
"My empire lives in every grain of sand."
"Shurima's legacy will endure."
"We are the authors of history."
"I am Shurima's dawn."
"Everyone will know the name Shurima."
"No sacrifice is too great."
"We are made by our choices."
"We will unearth what has been lost."
"None know the will of the desert better than I."
"We walk a path of radiance."
"The Ascended shall guide humanity to greatness."
"This slumbering world must awaken."
"Shurima lives in me."
"Believe in our future."
"Loyalty will be rewarded."
"A ruler must choose his hour."
"There is no future without Shurima."
"Join me, and be elevated."
"All eyes look to us."
"Like the sun, Shurima always rises!"
"I will reclaim my stolen legacy!"
"You need not follow me, but you cannot stop me."
"Here, we shall decide the future of Shurima!"
"The future will be written by the Ascended!"
"Today, you will see the power of ascension!"
"There is only Shurima. All else is but a mirage."
"What is the desert, but the ashes of my enemies?"
"When every trace of you is lost, I will remain."
"You must learn respect, Sivir."
"Accept your destiny, Sivir."
"Rise with Shurima, Sivir, or fall beneath it."
"Renekton, once a noble warrior, now naught but a mad beast."
"You have forgotten yourself, Renekton."
"You are but a grain of sand, Xerath."
"Emperors have no rivals, Xerath. Only liabilities."
"Xerath, it is time your spark went out."
"You have already failed, Xerath. You must now accept it."
"Traitor, I cast you to the winds."
"You are but my shadow, Xerath."
"Xerath, the time of your judgment has come."
"So, a pigeon walks into a bar..."
"For emperors, it's all about how you carry yourself."
"I will open their eyes."
"The unworthy have no place in history."
"See what I see."
"Ancient power courses through me."
"Fate is in our hands."
"They dare defy Shurima?"
"With a word, I end you."
"Challenge Shurima, challenge fate."
"Never cross an emperor."
"Shurima will brook no offense."
"Behold the desert's wrath."
"Mine is the will of Shurima."
"They have overstepped."
"Give yourselves to Shurima."
"You dare oppose me?"
"Soon, none will question us."
"Who denies our right to rule?"
"Eventually, the sands claim us all."
"No beast will stop us!"
"We will overcome this monster!"
"What is a baron to an emperor?"
"Emperors have no need of barons."
"No dragon can defeat us!"

"I'll never be like this guy."
"I had a crush‚Ä¶ until you started talking to the gun."
"Guns. Original."
"You give Zaun a bad name."
"I lost a pet rat once. Is that you, Mr. Tails?"
"Take my time machine, Urgot. You clearly need it more."
"I'll poke your eye out‚Ä¶ head out‚Ä¶ face off? How do you even work?"
"Hey, sellout!"
"You forgot your roots, Vi."
"You'll always be Zaun to me."
"You used to be cool."
"One day, you'll come back to Zaun."
"Never go full robot."
"You're everything wrong with Zaun."
"I'll never be like this guy."
"Timefight!"
"I really hope you're not the future me."
"Uh‚Ä¶ if anyone sees my paradox, ask 'im where I am."
"The timeline was already this broken when I found it. I swear."
"Let me be honest, I have no idea what I'm doing."
"This is the longest second of my life."
"Time scramble doesn't travel my brain."
"How many Pilties does it take to make a hammer? All of 'em! Hehe‚Ä¶"
"How many Pilties does it take to make a hammer? Zero! They make 'em in Zaun!"
"How many Pilties does it take to make a hammer? Two, if you count Jayce's reflection! Haha! Oh, Jayce."
"We'll do it the hard way!"
"I could make this hurt less."
"Make me repeat myself!"
"Time is not on your side!"
"Should've walked away."
"I like hitting you!"
"Good a time as any to act reckless."
"Haha‚Ä¶ you never see this coming."
"Come on! Show me something new!"
"Welcome to Zaun!"
"I'll help you this time. Duck."
"All out of warnings."
"This is how we say 'hello' in Zaun."
"Last chance to be anywhere else."
"Keep pushing me."
"Catch!"
"Heads up!"
"Don't blink!"
"Think fast!"
"Step right up!"
"Come get me!"
"Made it!"
"Surprise!"
"Time snap!"
"Go!"
"Look out!"
"Do-over!"
"One more time!"
"Reversing polarity!"
"Gotta' do better than that, law-dog!"
"Next time, shoot where I'm gonna' be!"
"Were you trying to hit me?"
"Swing and a miss, top hat!"
"I'm no angel."
"Yep. Put an angel on the job. I could use a break."
"I'm sure I won't be needing this‚Ä¶ but I'll take it anyhow."
"A second chance? I thought I was on my fifth!"
"I love hitting Pilties with their own toys."
"Put a gun on a sword; typical Piltover brilliance."
"Let's go hunt some liches?"
"All in‚Äî just my style."
"It's like it was made for me."
"How can I not buy this?"
"And I'm fighting with teeth."
"That is one big tooth."
"Not much of a hat guy‚Ä¶ but this thing is awesome!"
"Rabadon must've been a fun guy."
"Some things do get better with time."
"Yep; this thing has a bright future."
"Sometimes, age has its benefits."
"Three forces at work."
"Triple threat."
"Can't hide your weak spots from me!"
"This thing creeps me out."
"Huh. Freezing time. Interesting."
"Stops time? Huh. Thought I'd never get a break."
"I'm old enough to buy this."
"You gotta' teach me that trick, Zil!"
"I coulda' survived that‚Äî but thanks anyway."
"I need to rethink a couple things."
"Back before anyone notices."
"Taking a breather."
"They'll wish I stayed here."
"Yep‚Ä¶ that went exactly how I didn't want it to go."
"Back to square seven."
"Let's not do that again."
"Second first time for everything!"
"That worked in another timeline."

"Only the spider is safe in her web."
"Weak willed fools!"
"I know what lurks in the shadows."
"I know the true path."
"There's nothing to fear."
"Pull the strings. Watch them dance."
"We must all make sacrifices."
"I can show them the way to divinity."
"My true beauty is beneath the skin."
"They need‚Ä¶ guidance."
"Every web, a masterpiece."
"Come closer, I don't bite!"
"The spider, I. And you, the fly."
"I hear a man likes a lady with legs."
"Hmm, why so tense? Relax."
"I have‚Ä¶ refined tastes."
"The spider demands sacrifice."
"Ah, the tangled webs we weave."
"Dangling by a thread."
"Weak willed fools!"
It will all be over soon."

"I long for a worthy opponent."
"Poor form!"
"Precision and grace."
"I have no equal."
"Do not hesitate."
"Sharp blade, sharp mind."
"Others try. I succeed."
"At once."
"In the blink of an eye."
"Is this supposed to be a challenge?"
"Such unrefined style."
"Submit! You have already lost."
"I like you. I hate to kill you."
"Talent, honor, discipline, and pretty pictures!"
"I am an artist with a sword, in more ways than one."
"Insolent peasants!"
"Run them through!"
"Prepare to die."
"They dare not strike back."
"To the death."
"I never hold back."
"Strike quickly, strike deftly."
"En garde!"
"Try me!"
"Your move."
"Stand ready."
"One step ahead!"
"Poor form!"
"Too slow!"
"Try again."
